# SQL-to-Natural-Language-Assistant-using-LLM
This project converts natural language questions into SQL queries and returns the results as clear, plain English answers. The main goal of this project is to understand how Large Language Models (LLMs) can interact with real databases using LangChain, without relying on any web interface.
